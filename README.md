# Palworld_BreedChain_Calculator
This Script Calculates a successful breeding path to a target Pal with a specified Inherited Pal (or pals). There can be multiple inherited pals, and excluded pals can also be specified (in the event you don't have the pal!)


The packaged .exe file was >25 MB (~100 mb, so I can't upload it here. If you have ideas on how to do that, let me know!

When adding pals to the inherited and excluded lists, do not add commas between the pal names.

This script also cannot handle special combination target species. I plan to work on this in the next few days and upload a change to allow for it.
